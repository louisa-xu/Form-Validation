                <li>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?</li>
                <p>Responsive design is a user-centered design that renders well on a variety of devices by
                    automatically adjusting the display of content layout for different screen sizes.</p>

                <li>How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</li>
                <p>With the development of technology, internet has become an indispensable part of everyday life. Web
                    development has become one of the most popular technologies, with user experience becoming an
                    essential component in the development process. To make the product user-friendly, the end product
                    must work well with all types of electronic/digital devices. And the most basic element is
                    responsive design which caters the web design to accommodate all types of screen sizes. This
                    function is realized through incorporating responsive adjustment component into CSS and JavaScript
                    technologies.</p>

                <li>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?</li>
                <p>Building web apps today is not revolved around desktop browsers, but more towards the accommodating
                    to different devices, platforms, and screen sizes. There are advantages of building a single webapp
                    for different devices. First, it has lower cost to develop a single application than developing one
                    for each platform. Secondly, it can be accessed just through a web browser and can reach wider
                    audience. However, there are also disadvantages of building web apps for different devices. First,
                    browser compatibility has become a very common problem in developing web apps. There may be
                    browser-specific issues that prevent smooth functionalities on different devices. Second, the design
                    of desktop web apps may not fit well when it moves to a smaller screen device like cellphone. The
                    general layout and elements like font size need to be re-evaluated for and adapted to different
                    screen sizes to create a better user experience. Third, user interface guidelines for different
                    platforms (Android, iOS, Windows) need to be considered when developing applications to make sure
                    the web app displays smoothly on different devices.</p>

                <li>Describe your learning experience in the course.</li>
                <p>Before I started this course, I honestly expected it to be much easier than the C/C++ course.
                    However, now reaching the end of the course, I have changed my opinion towards the course and would
                    rank it as hard as C/C++. I have done some reflections on why Iâ€™m a little struggled with this
                    course and have found the following reasons:
                <ol>
                    <li>JavaScript is a weakly typed language whereas C/C++ are strongly typed languages. Having learnt
                        C/C++ beforehand and getting used to the strict rules where everything is clear and not
                        ambiguous, I find certain JavaScript rules to be quite confusing and ambiguous. Because of the
                        nature of weakly typed language, most of the time there is no error at compile time but at
                        runtime, which can make debugging quite difficult. </li>
                    <li>HTML/CSS are easy to understand and learn but the body of knowledge is not as systematic as real
                        programming languages. The body of knowledge is quite scattered and requires a lot of
                        memorizations of different rules. Browser compatibility can have a big impact on the codes as
                        well. In general, to get hang of and to memorize different rules of HTML/CSS, a lot of hands-on
                        practice on projects and experiments are required.</li>
                    <li>Since I expected the course to be fairly easy and fundamental, and since this course did not
                        have as heavy workload as other courses, I did not spend as much time on this course as I spent
                        on other courses. I think this is the main reason I was struggling a little with this course.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br />
                Having analyzed the reasons as above, I have decided to take advantage of the study breaks after
                final exam to review the course material and spend time to work on some projects to really
                strength my knowledge to get ready for the next semester.
